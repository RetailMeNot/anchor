/*
Anchor exports icons at the same level as every other component so there's no way to differentiate
them from another component. Rather than modifying anchor to make my life easier, I'm treating this
as how any user might interact with the library, so I'm grabbing all the icons in this file and exporting
them in order to loop over them all.
