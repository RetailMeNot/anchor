# ComponentInfo

This component is designed to read from the <a
target="blank"
href="//github.com/RetailMeNot/anchor/blob/master/docs/src/components/Utils/sections.ts#L30">`sections`</a>
object that is also part of `Utils`.  It accepts the name of an Anchor component, then uses that to
pull the description property of that component and render it to the page.

It has two modes, `all` and `description`. When set to `all`, the entire list of components are
rendered including links to their full documentation entries on this site, and their code on
GitHub.

```tsx live
<ComponentInfo title="Avatar" />
```
