# Introduction

###### Don't Address the Symptoms, Address the Problem

> In simpler times, the staff at mental health institutions used an unusual technique to
help judge whether a patient was well enough to be released. They would put a stopper in the sink of
a janitor’s closet and turn the water on until the sink was overflowing onto the floor. Then, they
would give a patient a mop and send them into the closet with instructions to clean up the mess.

> They would leave the patient alone for a few minutes and then come back to see how the patient
dealt with the problem. If the patient was simply mopping away at the water that was overflowing
from the sink onto the floor without figuring out the root of the problem by turning the water off
and pulling the plug, it was determined that this patient was not yet ready to be released.

<br />

Far too many of us act like that mental patient, spending an enormous amount of time trying to mop
up the messes we see without getting to the root of the problem. But no matter how much mopping we
do, if the stopper is still in the sink and the water is still running, we haven’t remedied the
problem.

###### What is a Design System?

> A collection of reusable components, governed by clear standards, that can be assembled together
to build any number of applications or products.

<br />

For a long time in software companies the practice of building software as one-off initiatives
at has been called into question and deemed insular. It's no longer acceptable
to deliver a piece of software that solves a particular problem and call it a 'solution'. As new
requirements emerge, narrowing our focus just to a particular challenge's requirements
results in organizational tension, substandard solutions, churn, code rot, technical debt, etc.


###### Have you experienced any of these problems?

* Unable to ship software on a consistent, frequent basis?
* Shipping software with myriad inconsistencies (not just UX, either)?
* Struggling to adopt new methodologies and technologies that open new opportunities?
* Introducing **verschlimmbesserungs** (supposed improvements that make everything worse)?
* Inflated estimates?
* Create sub-standard products that take more time?
* Trimming an MVP so heavily that you're celebrating just the M?
* Supporting radically different architectures for like-solutions?
* Rarely excited about what's being delivered?

A **design system** is about building solutions. Instead of multiple code bases combating the same
mundane UI/UX challenges with unique solutions, institue a central system robust enough to handle
the common UI and UX challenges faced by every team at an organization. This then allows each team
within that organization to begin solving their unique challenges on that shared foundation.

#### Anchor is all about trying to solve the core of the problem, not the symptoms.
