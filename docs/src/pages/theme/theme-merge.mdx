# themeMerge()

`themeMerge` is a utility function which returns a deep cloned object based on a settings object
passed by the user along with a base theme object. If no base theme object is provided, `themeMerge`
defaults to **Anchor**'s <Link to="/theme/root-theme">`RootTheme`</Link>.

**Arguments**

* `settings` (object): The settings the user wishes to merge with a base theme object.
* `baseTheme` (object): the base theme for which settings will merge with. Defaults
to <Link to="/theme/root-theme">`RootTheme`</Link> if not provided.

The `baseTheme` should resemble `RootTheme`'s default data structure below for it to work across
all **Anchor** components.

```jsx hideTitle
{
    [key: string]?: any;
    borders?: object;
    buttons?: object;
    colors?: object;
    inputs?: object;
    radii?: object;
    skeleton?: object;
    typography?: object;
}
```

**Return**
* `object`: A new deeply cloned object based on the two passed objects.

```jsx
    import { themeMerge, ThemeProvider } from '@retailmenot/anchor';
    import { App } from '/components/App';  // An example path

    const MyTheme = themeMerge({
        fonts: {
            base: 'Arial, sans-serif',
        },
    });

    const Root = () => (
        <ThemeProvider theme={MyTheme}>
            <App />
        </ThemeProvider>
    );
    ReactDOM.render(Root, document.getElementById('app'));
```

## Removing Fields ##

It is also possible to remove fields from the base theme object. This can be useful in some situations
where a default style is difficult to work around. This is intended to be used to remove a
single css property, but it is not limited to that. Properties whose values are objects along with
their children can also be removed, though none of the root properties can be. In the example below
the `mono` property is being removed from the theme.

Try changing `mono` to `base`, and see in the resulting example how `mono` returns and now `base` is
removed.

```tsx live
<ThemeExplorer openTo="fonts" theme={themeMerge({
    fonts: {
        mono: undefined,
    },
})}
/>
```

*NOTE! Use this feature with caution. If fields
from <Link to="/theme/root-theme">`RootTheme`</Link> are removed it is likely that css styles will
not be properly applied to some **Anchor** components.*

## Practical Example ##

Here is this site's settings merged in with <Link to="/theme/root-theme">`RootTheme`</Link> using
`themeMerge`.

```tsx live
<ThemeExplorer theme={themeMerge({
    colors: {
        primary: {
            base: '#DF206C',
            light: '#E665A1',
            dark: '#B81D5B',
        },
        secondary: {
            base: '#EB663D',
            light: '#FA9F5A',
            dark: '#C74E30',
        },
        accent: {
            base: '#E3EEF6',
            light: '#0998D6',
            dark: '#0074A6',
        },
        borders: {
            light: '#F1F1F1',
            base: '#E7E7E7',
            dark: '#D3D3D3',
        },
        background: {
            base: '#FAFAFA',
            code: '#F1F1F1',
        },
        text: {
            link: {
                hover: '#DF206C',
            },
        },
    },
    borders: {
        light: 'solid thin #F1F1F1',
        base: 'solid thin #E7E7E7',
        dark: 'solid thin #D3D3D3',
    },
})} />
```
