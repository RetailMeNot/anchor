# RootTheme

The look of all of **Anchor**'s components are guided by
the <Link to="/theme/theme-provider">`ThemeProvider`</Link>, but the `ThemeProvider` is
nothing without a theme to provide. That is why **Anchor** includes `RootTheme`, with settings to
declare things like borders, colors, font families and everything inbetween. The documentation
below will dissect the `RootTheme`, but it's a good idea to review the documentation on
<a href="https://xstyled.dev/" target="_blank">xstyled</a>'s implementation
of <a href="https://xstyled.dev/docs/theming/" target="_blank">theming</a> with
an emphasis on <a href="https://xstyled.dev/docs/theme-specification/" target="_blank">theme
specification</a>.

The box below is an interactive representation of the `RootTheme`. If you select the **Sticky**
option it will stay at the top of the page while you continue to read and selecting **Collapse**
will collapse the entire structure making the rest of the documentation easier to read.

## Usage & Modifying

The `RootTheme` is a JavaScript object. Its top-level keys are important as the `ThemeProvider` looks
for them specifically (again, check
out <a href="https://xstyled.dev/docs/theme-specification/" target="_blank">theme specification</a>).
**Anchor** does not use every key from the theme specification and actually adds a few of its own.

###### RootTheme, top level
```jsx hideTitle
    {
        borders: {...},
        breakpoints: {...},
        colors: {...},
        fonts: {...},
        radii: {...},

        // Anchor specific
        buttons: {...},
        inputs: {...},
        skeleton: {...},
        typography: {...},
    }
```

Because the `RootTheme` is a JavaScript object, creating a theme with new values is as simple as
importing the `RootTheme` and overwriting the existing values.

**Anchor** also ships with a <Link to="/theme/theme-merge">`themeMerge`</Link> utility function to
help generate a theme, but it's recommended to understand the basics of the `RootTheme` before
using it.

```jsx
import { RootTheme } from '@retailmenot/anchor';

export const MyTheme = {
    ...RootTheme,
    fonts: {
        ...RootTheme.fonts
        base: 'Comic Sans, sans-serif',
    }
};
```

If `MyTheme` was then given to a site's `ThemeProvider`, all **Anchor** components would use
`Comic Sans` as their font. Why? Because **Anchor**'s styled components are written to use the keys
that are supplied by the ThemeProvider. Take a look at the code for the `Typography`
component <a href="https://github.com/RetailMeNot/anchor/blob/master/src/Typography/Typography.component.tsx#L100" target="_blank">here</a>.
Notice that the value for `fontFamily` is `base`, not the name of the font. This is the essence of
theming, a layer of abstraction that easily allows sweeping changes to the look of all styled
components.

This doesn't just apply to **Anchor** components though. Any styled component that is a child of a
`ThemeProvider` that has access to that theme can also tap into it.

```jsx
import styled from '@xstyled/styled-components';
import { ThemeProvider } from '@retailmenot/anchor';
import { App } from './components/App'; // This path is just an example
import { MyTheme } from './utils/MyTheme'; // This path is just an example

const Title = styled('h1')`
    font-family: base;
    color: primary.light;
`;

export const Example = () => (
    <ThemeProvider theme={MyTheme}>
        <Title>I'll Be in Comic Sans and purplish!</Title>
        <App />
    </ThemeProvider>
);
```

*NOTE! It's a good idea to extend the `RootTheme` or override its values rather than create a theme
from scratch. All **Anchor** components are designed to reference established keys from the
`RootTheme`.*

## Breakdown

Now that we know how to use `RootTheme` (or a custom theme based on it), here is a breakdown of
its key/values.

---

#### borders
The CSS properties, `border`, `border-top`, `border-right`, `border-bottom`, and `border-left`
can all reference to the keys in `borders`.

<ThemeExplorer openTo="borders" />

---

#### breakpoints
`breakpoints` are an interesting black-sheep in this otherwise straightforward implementation of a
theme. Their primary purpose is to tie into
the <a href="https://xstyled.dev/docs/responsive/#create-a-responsive-component" target="_blank">`breakpoints()`</a> function
which generates media queries for styled components.

*NOTE! **Anchor** does not access any breakpoint strictly by its key name. The few components that
tie into them are written in a way to avoid it. Refer to the documentation
on <Link to="/components/responsiveprovider">`ResponsiveProvider`</Link> for more detail.*

<ThemeExplorer openTo="breakpoints" />

---

#### colors
`colors` is a group of generalized and abstracted keys which don't (typically) associate directly
to a specific color name. Instead they refer to usage, such as `primary` or `text`. These are further
classified by `light`, `dark`, `base`, or even `error`.

The CSS properties, `color`, `background-color` and `border-color` can all reference the keys in
`colors`.

<ThemeExplorer openTo="colors" />

---

#### fonts
The CSS property, `font-family` can reference the keys in `fonts`.

<ThemeExplorer openTo="fonts" />

---

#### radii
The CSS property, `border-radius`  can reference the keys in `radii`.

<ThemeExplorer openTo="radii" />

---

## Anchor Specific Breakdown
The remaining top-level keys are added just for **Anchor**. Unlike the keys from
the <a href="https://xstyled.dev/docs/theme-specification/" target="_blank">theme specification</a>,
they can't be accessed without using
the <a href="https://xstyled.dev/docs/system-utilities/#theme-getters" target="_blank">`th()`</a> helper
function within a styled component.

```jsx
import styled from '@xstyled/styled-components';
import { th } from '@xstyled/system';

const Example = styled('div')`
    display: inline-block;
    background-color: ${th('skeleton.colorStart')};
`;
```

---


#### buttons

These settings are used for the <Link to="/components/button">`Button`</Link> component. The first
grouping, `sizes`, is fairly straightforward. Though the units are not explictly declared, they are
all assumed to be `rem`.

The second grouping, `variants` is slightly more complicated. The value listed for all of them is
`func()`. This is because `Button` has a function that exists between it and it's final styling based
not just on `variants`, but also `disabled`, and `reverse`. It is possible to override this function
with your own styling, such as using the `css()` utility
from [@xstyled/styled-components](https://xstyled.dev/docs/migrate-from-styled-components/#css-utility-is-required).

```tsx live
<Component initialState={{theme: {
    ...RootTheme,
    buttons: {
        ...RootTheme.buttons,
        variants: {
            ...RootTheme.buttons.variants,
            filled: {
                ...RootTheme.buttons.variants.filled,
                base: css({
                    color: 'white',
                    backgroundColor: 'red',
                }),
                hover: css({
                    color: 'red',
                    backgroundColor: 'white',
                }),
            },
        },
    },
}}}>
    {({state}) => (
        <ThemeProvider theme={state.theme}>
            <Typography as="h3" pb={3}>
                The default 'variant' for 'Button' is 'filled', which is why the button immediately
                takes on the new colors.
            </Typography>

            <Button>Example Button</Button>
        </ThemeProvider>
    )}
</Component>
```

<ThemeExplorer openTo="buttons" />

---

#### inputs

These settings are used for the <Link to="/components/input">`Input`</Link> component. They control
both the semantic `input` tag's styles, as well as the wrapping container.

<ThemeExplorer openTo="inputs" />

---

#### skeleton

The <Link to="/components/skeleton">`Skeleton`</Link> component uses the color values here in its
pulsing animation. These values are kept here, rather as a configuration prop for the component, in
order to affect all `Skeleton` components used on a site at once.

<ThemeExplorer openTo="skeleton" />

___

#### typography

These settings are used for the <Link to="/components/typography">`Typography`</Link> component.
Of particular interest are the values under `tag`. The `Typography` component can act as many
semantic HTML tags when using its `tag` prop. When doing so, the styles for that tag will be
automatically applied to it, in addition to those defined immediately under `tag`.

```jsx
    // This component assumes that a ThemeProvider with the RootTheme
    // is already set in the application
    import { Typography } from '@retailmenot/anchor';

    const Example = () => (
        <section>
            <Typography as="h2">Welcome!</Typography>
            <Typography as="p">Lorem Ipsum etc, etc...</Typography>
        <section>
    );

    {/*
        The first Typography tag (h2) will have the following styles:
            fontWeight:normal
            fontSize:1.5rem
            lineHeight:2rem

        And the second Typography tag (p) will have these:
            fontWeight:normal
            fontSize:1rem
            lineHeight:1.5rem
    */}
```

<ThemeExplorer openTo="typography" />
