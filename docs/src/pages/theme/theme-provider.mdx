# Theme Provider

**Anchor** components depend on the `ThemeProvider` to read values from, providing theme context to
all styled components. `ThemeProvider` is an exported module from **Anchor**, but it is the same
module found in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.smooth-code.com/open-source/xstyled/">`@xstyled/styled-components`</a> and
`styled-components`, so any of them will work interchangably.

Of course without a theme, `ThemeProvider` isn't very useful. **Anchor** ships with a `RootTheme`
which is passed via the `theme` prop. When wrapped around an application, the colors, fonts and
other settings in the `theme` are made available to any child component.

```jsx
import { ThemeProvider, RootTheme } from '@retailmenot/anchor';
import { App } from '/components/App';  // An example path

const Root = () => (
    <ThemeProvider theme={RootTheme}>
        <App />
    </ThemeProvider>
);

ReactDOM.render(Root, document.getElementById('app'));
```

## RootTheme

As noted above, `RootTheme` contains properties for a number of component settings. Below is a
high-level output of `RootTheme`.

###### console.log(RootTheme)
```jsx hideTitle
{
  "borders": { ... }
  "breakpoints": { ... },
  "buttons": { ... },
  "colors": { ... },
  "radii": { ... },
  "typography": { ... },
}
```

### borders

Basic border settings for components.

### breakpoints

Currently **Anchor** doesn't make extensive use of this setting. It only has a single
property, `xs`. This may be re-evaluated in a future update.

### buttons

The <Link to="/components/button">`Button`</Link> component is one of the most configurable, so much
so that it relies on the settings defined here to function correctly. Most of these properties
actually come from module exports from <Link to="/components/button">`Button`</Link>, so it is not
recommended to alter these values.

### colors

The `colors` property is arguably one of the most important. `RootTheme` provides a structure for
the various color swatches available from the <Link to="/theme/colors/">`colors`</Link> object, a
structure from which **Anchor** components rely on to properly render their styles. As a matter of
fact, the fastest way to realize that `ThemeProvider` and/or `RootTheme` are not being correctly
applied to an application is because of a lack of color.

The properties of `color` are important enough that within the code for generating `RootTheme`, it
is referred to as a `ColorTheme`. Notice that the properties of this `ColorTheme` are abstracted
(for the most part). This is an intentional choice, because ultimately the point of any theme is to
apply very different colors but with a similar naming scheme. Consider Google's use of terms such
as, `comfortable`, `cozy`, `light` and `dark` as an example of this approach.

**Anchor** components will always refer to color usage via the properties of this `ColorTheme`. In
other words, if a component wanted to use the `light` hue of `grapePurchase`, it would refer to it
as `primary.light`.

It's important to note that the <Link to="/theme/colors/">`colors`</Link> object that ships
with **Anchor** is not the same thing as the `RootTheme`. <Link to="/theme/colors/">`colors`</Link> is
intended to be used when one has a very specific need for a color swatch. Most of the examples of the
components on this site use the <Link to="/theme/colors/">`colors`</Link> object in cases where the
`RootTheme` didn't apply a color.

###### ColorTheme Example
```jsx hideTitle
...
colors: {
    primary: colors.grapePurchase,
    accent: colors.savvyCyan,
    secondary: colors.dealEnvy,
    neutrals: {
        white: colors.white,
        ash: colors.ash,
        silver: colors.silver,
        charcoal: colors.charcoal,
    },
    borders: {
        // PRAGMATIC
        light: colors.silver.base,
        base: colors.ash.light,
        dark: colors.ash.dark,
        // SEMANTIC
        error: colors.ash.dark,
        success: colors.ash.dark,
    },
    text: {
        body: colors.charcoal.base,
        link: {
            base: colors.savvyCyan.dark,
            hover: colors.savvyCyan.dark,
            focus: colors.savvyCyan.dark,
            visited: colors.savvyCyan.dark,
        },
        disabled: colors.ash.light,
        placeholder: colors.ash.dark,
    },
    background: {
        body: colors.silver.base,
        content: colors.white.base,
    },
    error: colors.fireSale.dark,
    success: colors.dealEnvy.dark,
};
...
```

### radii

The properties here will determine the `border-radius` applied to components.

### typography

As the name implies, `typography` holds properties dealing with font settings. The
actual <Link to="/components/typography">`Typography`</Link> component relies on the properties
defined here, but any component that has text displayed will tap into this as well.
