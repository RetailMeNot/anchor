# Theme Provider

**Anchor** components depend on the `ThemeProvider` to read values from, providing theme context to
all styled components. `ThemeProvider` is an exported module from **Anchor**, but it is the same
module found in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.smooth-code.com/open-source/xstyled/">`@xstyled/styled-components`</a> and
`styled-components`, so any of them will work interchangably.

Of course without a theme, `ThemeProvider` isn't very useful. **Anchor** ships with
a <Link to="/theme/root-theme">`RootTheme`</Link> which is passed via the `theme` prop. When wrapped
around an application, the colors, fonts and other settings in the `theme` are made available to any
child component.

```jsx
import { ThemeProvider, RootTheme } from '@retailmenot/anchor';
import { App } from '/components/App';  // An example path

const Root = () => (
    <ThemeProvider theme={RootTheme}>
        <App />
    </ThemeProvider>
);

ReactDOM.render(Root, document.getElementById('app'));
```

*NOTE! If components from Anchor don't look right it's usually because the `ThemeProvider` has not
been defined high enough up in the application tree.*
