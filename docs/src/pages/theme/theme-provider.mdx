# ThemeProvider

Theming is one of the great strengths of styled-components, and **Anchor** uses it heavily in all of
its components. It does this by way of the `ThemeProvider` component from
the [@xstyled/styled-components](https://www.smooth-code.com/open-source/xstyled/) library. This
library, in conjunction with [@xstyled/system](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@xstyled/system),
offers many features that `styled-components` alone do not.

**It is required that `ThemeProvider` exist in your application tree. Anchor components will render
if it's not included, but without their styles.**

Of course without a theme, `ThemeProvider` isn't very useful. **Anchor** ships with
a <Link to="/theme/root-theme">`RootTheme`</Link> which is passed via the `theme` prop. When wrapped
around an application, the colors, fonts and other settings in the `theme` are made available to any
child component.

```jsx
import { ThemeProvider } from '@xstyled/styled-components';
import { RootTheme } from '@retailmenot/anchor';
import { App } from '/components/App';  // An example path

const Root = () => (
    <ThemeProvider theme={RootTheme}>
        <App />
    </ThemeProvider>
);

ReactDOM.render(Root, document.getElementById('app'));
```

*NOTE! If components from Anchor don't look right it's usually because the `ThemeProvider` has not
been defined high enough up in the application tree.*
