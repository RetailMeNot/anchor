# colors

The `colors` object that comes with **Anchor** are colors based on those used
by <a href="//retailmenot.com" target="_blank">RetailMeNot</a>.
This pallete is used by the <Link to="/theme/theme-provider">`RootTheme`</Link> object, and serves
as the basis for the styles used by default for all components.

Most code examples for the components on this site use the `colors` object. For example:

```tsx live
<Heart color="primary.light" scale="lg" />
```

Shown below are all of the various colors along with their hues (`base`, `light` and `dark`). Each
color swatch has 4 pills representing the color contrast when used on these colors:

* `#FFFFFF`
* `#FAFAFA`
* `#F1F1F1`
* `#000000`
