# Icon

All of the icons are `svg`'s, and can be colored and scaled as needed. **Anchor** does not group all
of the icons together, rather they are individually imported in order to keep the bundle size small.
All icons are rendered individually by their name, i.e. **`ArrowBack`** or **`Expand`**, as shown below.

#### Available Icons

There are currently <IconCount /> icons available. Note that you can try any of these icons in the **Live Code Editor**.

<Collapse openedText="SHOW/HIDE ALL ICONS" isOpen={true}>
    <IconList />
</Collapse>

<br />

#### Live Code Editor

```tsx live
<section>
    <div>
        <Star color="red" />
    </div>

    <div>
        <AvatarIcon scale="xl" />
    </div>
</section>
```

<br />

### Props

* `color`: Defaults to **`currentColor`**, a SVG color property that will allow the icon to inherit its parent color.
However, if a value is passed it will take whatever hex/rgb/rgba value provided.
* `scale`: Defaults to **`md`**, which translates to 16px by 16px. The full range of options are **`'xs', 'sm', 'md', 'lg', 'xl', 'xxl'`**
* `className`: An additional class name. All icons have the **`anchor-icon`** class name in addition to a more specific class.
Ex: **`class="anchor-icon arrow-back"`**.
