# Collapse

The Collapse component allows a user to click on a button and toggle the rendering of its child.
This site uses this component and the `CollapseGroup` component for its side navigation. Note that it
does not simply show/hide content, it re-renders it.

When using the **Live Code Editor**, you can use any <Link to="/components/icon">Icon component</Link>
available in **Anchor** for the `openedIcon` and `closedIcon` props.

#### Live Code Editor

```tsx live
<Collapse>
    I will appear and disappear when the rendered button is clicked!
</Collapse>
```

<br />

### Props

* `isOpen` *(boolean)*: Defaults to **`false`**. Determines whether the Collapse component is open or not. Changing the value of this prop will programatticaly open/close the component, thusly not requiring a click event.
* `openedText` *(string)*: Defaults to **`'Close'`**. The text that appears on the button as a Call To Action (CTA) when the component is open. If this prop is used and the `closedText` prop is not, `closedText` will use whatever is defined for `openedText`. This is useful if you don't actually want the CTA text to change.
* `closedText` *(string)*: Defaults to **`'Open'`**. The text that appears on the button as a CTA when the component is closed.
* `openedIcon` *(React.ReactElement)*: Defaults to **`<ChevronDown />`** from `Icon`. Accepts any component to render, although realistically sticking to components from `Icon` make the most sense.
* `closedIcon` *(React.ReactElement)*: Defaults to **`<ChevronUp />`** from `Icon`. Accepts any component to render, although realistically sticking to components from `Icon` make the most sense.

#### openedIcon and/or closedIcon usage

```tsx live
<Collapse
    openedIcon={<ArrowBack />}
    closedIcon={<ArrowForward />}
>
    <div>Hello world.</div>
</Collapse>
```

* `variant` *('comfortable' | 'compact' | 'none')*: Defaults to **`'comfortable'`**.
    * **comfortable**: has considerable spacing. It is intended to be used for showing/hiding larger pieces of content.
    * **compact**: has much tighter spacing. It is intended to be used for showing/hiding navigation elements.
    * **none**: Applies no styling whatsoever to the component. Useful for when you want complete control of all styling via styled-components/css/etc., but still keep the functionality of the component. The component has many classes in place to try and make it easier to accomplish this.
* `hasBottomBorder`: *(boolean)*: Defaults to **`true`**. Shows/hides the bottom border.

# CollapseGroup

The **`CollapseGroup`** component combines multiple **`Collapse`** components together, allowing a single component to apply props to all children, unifying their appearance, and adding the ability to have accordion functionality.

#### Live Code Editor

```tsx live
<CollapseGroup variant="compact">
    <Collapse>
        I will appear and disappear when the rendered button is clicked!
    </Collapse>
    <Collapse>
        I will also appear and disappear when the rendered button is clicked!
    </Collapse>
</CollapseGroup>
```

### Props

* `openedIcon` *(React.ReactElement)*: No default. Using this prop will apply the setting to all child **`Collapse`** components. Otherwise its functionality is as noted above for **`Collapse`**.
* `closedIcon` *(React.ReactElement)*: No default. Using this prop will apply the setting to all child **`Collapse`** components. Otherwise its functionality is as noted above for **`Collapse`**.
* `variant` *('comfortable' | 'compact' | 'none')*: No default. Using this prop will apply the setting to all child **`Collapse`** components. Otherwise its functionality is as noted above for **`Collapse`**.
* `accordion` *(boolean)*: Defaults to **`false`**. Enables accordion functionality, where only one **`Collapse`** component can be open at a time.
* `openIndex` *(number)*: Defaults to **`0`**. If **`accordion`** is set to **`true`**, this determines which **`Collapse`** component will start in the open state.
