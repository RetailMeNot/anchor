# Collapse

The Collapse component allows a user to click on a button and toggle the rendering of its child.
This site uses this component and the `CollapseGroup` component for its side navigation. Note that it
does not simply show/hide content, it re-renders it.

When using the **Live Code Editor**, you can use any <Link to="/components/icon">Icon component</Link>
available in **Anchor** for the `openedIcon` and `closedIcon` props.

```tsx live
<Collapse
    closedIcon={<ArrowForward />}
    closedText={'Open Me'}
    hasBottomBorder={true}
    isOpen={false}
    openedIcon={<ArrowBack />}
    openedText={'Close Me'}
    variant={'comfortable'}
>
    <div>Hello world.</div>
</Collapse>
```

## CollapseGroup

The **`CollapseGroup`** component combines multiple **`Collapse`** components together, allowing a single component to apply props to all children, unifying their appearance, and adding the ability to have accordion functionality.

```tsx live
<CollapseGroup
    accordion={true}
    closedIcon={<ArrowForward />}
    openedIcon={<ArrowBack />}
    openIndex={1}
    variant="compact"
>
    <Collapse>
        <Typography pl="5">
            I will appear and disappear when the rendered button is clicked!
        </Typography>
    </Collapse>
    <Collapse>
        <Typography pl="5">
            I will also appear and disappear when the rendered button is clicked!
        </Typography>
    </Collapse>
</CollapseGroup>
```
