# Adaptor

<ComponentInfo title="Adaptor" />

<br />

The `Adaptor` component is based on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-responsive" target="_blank">`react-responsive`</a>'s
component API, but it offers an additional feature: tying into the `breakpoints` property from
the <Link to="/components/responsiveprovider">`ResponsiveProvider`</Link> component.

The key's passed to the `from` and `to` fields are whatever breakpoints are set in
the <Link to="/components/responsiveprovider">`ResponsiveProvider`</Link>. As noted in the
documentation for that component, the keys and their values are entirely configurable. In the
example below, the values being used are what is shipped as the defaults from **Anchor**, `xs`, `sm`,
`md`, `lg`, `xl` and `xxl`.

```tsx live
<ThemeProvider theme={RootTheme}>
    <ResponsiveProvider debug>
        <Adaptor from="lg">
            <Typography as="p" pb="3">
                Visible from the 'lg' breakpoint on up.
            </Typography>
        </Adaptor>
        <Adaptor from="md" to="xxl">
            <Typography as="p" pb="3">
                Visible from the 'md' breakpoint until 'xxl'.
            </Typography>
        </Adaptor>
        <Adaptor minWidth="500px">
            <Typography as="p" pb="3">
                Visible from '500px' on up.
            </Typography>
        </Adaptor>
    </ResponsiveProvider>
</ThemeProvider>
```

    {
        property: 'from',

        <pre>to</pre> <i>cannot</i> be set without <pre>from</pre> as well.`,
