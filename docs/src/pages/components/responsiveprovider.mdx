# ResponsiveProvider

<ComponentInfo title="ResponsiveProvider" />

```jsx
import {
    ResponsiveProvider,
    RootTheme,
    ThemeProvider
} from '@retailmenot/anchor';
import { App } from './components/App'; // Just an example of a root application

export const Example = () => (
    <ThemeProvider theme={RootTheme}>
        <ResponsiveProvider>
            <App />
        </ResponsiveProvider>
    </ThemeProvider>
);
```

Similar to the `ThemeProvider` component, it's best to put the `ResponsiveProvider` component near
the top of an application. It passes responsive information down to other components, primary
amongst them the `Cell` component. In addition, `ResponsiveProvider`'s context is also available as
`ResponsiveContext`, which lets you access its data in your own components.

`ResponsiveProvider` contains 3 pieces of data: `breakpoints`, `current` and `innerWidth`.

---

## breakpoints
This is a sorted array of the breakpoints set in the `ThemeProvider`. Assuming the `RootTheme` is
fed to the `ThemeProvider`, these are the default settings for breakpoints in **Anchor**:

###### RootTheme Breakpoints
```jsx hideTitle
{
    ...RootTheme,
    // These are all minimums
    breakpoints: {
        xs: 0,
        sm: 576,
        md: 768,
        lg: 992,
        xl: 1200,
        xxl: 1600,
    },
}

// ResponsiveProvider would return the above as:
// [{xs: 0}, {sm: 576}, {md: 768}, {lg: 992}, {xl: 1200}, {xxl: 1600}]
```

If the application does not have a `ThemeProvider`, `ResponsiveProvider` will automatically pull in
the breakpoints from the `RootTheme`. In addition, you can provide your own breakpoints via
`ResponsiveProvider`'s `breakpoints` prop.

Note that your breakpoints do *not* have to be `xs`, `sm`, `md`, etc, you can have as many or as
few as you like and named whatever you want. Be aware that all **Anchor** components will use those
breakpoint keys/values.

###### Custom Breakpoints
```jsx hideTitle
{
    ...RootTheme,
    breakpoints: {
        jane: 0,
        bob: 700,
        evelyn: 1000,
    },
}

// ResponsiveProvider would return the above as:
// [{jane: 0}, {bob: 700}, {evelyn: 1000}]
```

---

### current

The current breakpoint key based on the `innerWidth`.

---

### innerWidth
The width, in pixels, of the current browser window. Updated on window resize, debounced to 100ms.

---

## Examples

###### Debug Mode (Live Editor)
```tsx live hideTitle
<ThemeProvider theme={RootTheme}>
    <ResponsiveProvider debug>
        <Typography tag="h3">
            See the black box in the bottom right corner? That's debug mode.
        </Typography>
    </ResponsiveProvider>
</ThemeProvider>
```

###### Using ResponsiveContext

<br />

This site already has the `ResponsiveProvider` in use at the top of the application, so the below
component is using `ResponsiveContext` to pull that data in via the `useContext` hook.

```jsx hideTitle
// VENDOR
import * as React from 'react';
import styled from '@xstyled/styled-components';
// COMPONENTS
import {
    ResponsiveContext,
    Typography
} from '@retailmenot/anchor';

const StyledResponsiveContextExample = styled('div')`
    padding: 1rem;
    border: base;
`;

export const ResponsiveContextExample = () => {
    const { breakpoints, current, innerWidth  } = React.useContext(ResponsiveContext);
    const breakpointKeys = breakpoints
        .map((breakpoint: object) => Object.keys(breakpoint)[0])
        .join(', ');

    return (
        <StyledResponsiveContextExample>
            <Typography tag="p" pb="2" weight={600}>breakpointKeys: {breakpointKeys}</Typography>
            <Typography tag="p" pb="2" weight={600}>current: {current}</Typography>
            <Typography tag="p" pb="2" weight={600}>innerWidth: {innerWidth}</Typography>
        </StyledResponsiveContextExample>
    );
};
```

And here's the result:

<br />

<ResponsiveContextExample />
