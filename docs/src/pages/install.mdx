## @xstyled/styled-components vs. styled-components

**Anchor** uses styled components extensively, but it opts to use
the [@xstyled/styled-components](https://www.smooth-code.com/open-source/xstyled/) library over
[styled-components](https://styled-components.com/). When installing **Anchor**, the
`@xstyled/styled-components` and `@xstyled/system` libraries will be installed as well since they are
dependencies, so the opportunity to use `@xstyled` will already be there.

Although it's not necessary to use `@xstyled`, it's recommended. It is a library that wraps around
`styled-components` and offers a robust feature-set that makes composing styled components and also
theming even more powerful.

All code examples on this site are written with `@xstyled`'s libraries.
