Anchor is a robust yet lightweight series of UI components, utilities, and styles that form the foundation of great user experiences.

### Get Started

```ssh
npm i -S @retailmenot/anchor styled-components
```

```typescript jsx
// VENDOR
import { Menu } from '@retailmenot/anchor';
```

[View our docs site for more usage guidelines](https://retailmenot.design/)

### Why Anchor?

* Isomorphic - We spent a lot of time trying to write out a library that doesn't require a Webpack expert to render server-side
* Convention Over Configuration - Out of the box this library solves common challenges faced by UI engineers without a ton of configuration
* Composability - Rather than writing redundant overrides, we provide consistent attributes to easily change the look and feel of our components
* Community - We promote people-centric solutions and promote a culture of learners
* Representational - We try to use native DOM APIs so the better you know the DOM the easier this library is to use
